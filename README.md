# Application Setup Instructions

Follow these steps to set up the application:

## 1) Database Setup

- Open the `create_database.sql` file and run it in your PostgreSQL environment. This script will create the necessary database schema.
- Next, run the `Generate-Data.sql` script to populate your database with 5000 lines of initial data.

## 2) Backend Setup

- Open a terminal and change directory into your `Backend` folder.
- Run `npm install` to install all the necessary dependencies.
- Open the `db.js` file and configure your SQL connection string to connect to your database.
- Start the backend server by running `nodemon run`.

## 3) Frontend Setup

- Open another terminal window and change directory into your `Frontend` folder.
- Run `npm install` to install all the frontend dependencies.
- Start the frontend development server by running `npm run dev`.

Follow these steps carefully to ensure that the application is set up correctly and ready to use.
